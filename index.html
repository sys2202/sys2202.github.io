                <strong><b>Labs: </b></strong>
                </p><p>On Friday morning at 9 am ET, ~bi-weekly laboratory assignments based upon course material will be posted via the Quizzes feature on the course Canvas site. 
                These assignments provide exercises in R and Python programming that supplement the material covered in class and provide the foundation for the projects. 
                Each lab assignment requires students to program in R or Python and answer questions. 
                <br> <br>The assignments are designed to assess your knowledge on programming concepts covered in class. 
                These assignments must be done individually, include an honor pledge, and be completed by Friday night at 11:59 pm ET, typically two weeks later. 
                While there is no time limit for these assignments, they are designed not to take more than 60 minutes. Laboratory sessions are excellent practice for exams 
                and real-world analysis under time constraints.

                </p><p>Hands-on activities will be used throughout the course to allow you to practice the methods covered in class, recognize opportunities to apply them in your own work, and discover their shortcomings.
                Students will submit their activity on Canvas for pass/fail credit.</p>

                  Each exam will contain a closed book section with short answer questions and an open book section 
                  requiring analytical problem solving. The Midterm will cover R and the Final will cover Python.</p>

                  We encourage you to do something related to your own interests and are happy to work with you in selecting a data source and defining a project. 
                  You must submit your topic description and data sources for your final project at the specified date on Canvas. In your final project, you must show competence in a subset of topics discussed in the class. 
                  Project deliverables are due on the last day of course. More information will be available at the midpoint in the semester. </p>

                <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to us by private message on Piazza
                  as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact

             </p><p>
              It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues 
              related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we 
              can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability 
              Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official 
              accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. 
              You may email her at <a href="mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu>cmacmasters@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment. 
              For general questions please visit the SDAC website: <a href=" sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu"="">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. 
              If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter 
              and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

               <p id="integrity" style="padding-top: 2em;">
               <strong><b>Academic Integrity Statement: </b></strong> 
                </p><p>"The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. 
                We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University's Honor principle that students will not lie, 
                cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can 
                destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles 
                of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 
                Students are expected to be familiar with the <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud">university honor code</a>, 
                including the section on academic fraud." <br>
                <br>In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any overlap in source code of 
                sufficient similarity will be potentially flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk
                about the assignment but not share code as this would potentially incur on an honor code violation.
                Regardless of circumstances we will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship
                of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded potentially
                as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating
          what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.</p>

              <p id="genai" style="padding-top: 2em;">
                <strong><b>The Use of Generative AI: </b></strong> 
        
                 </p><p>
                  Generative artificial intelligence tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, 
                  video, and other content—have become widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT for text and 
                  DALL•E for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our semester 
                  together. You may use generative AI tools on assignments in this course when I explicitly permit you to 
                  do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools. </p>
                  
                  <p>If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Cite the tool you used, following 
                  the pattern for computer software given in the specified style guide. Additionally, please include a brief 
                  description of how you used the tool. If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are 
                  typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained 
                  on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result 
                  in plagiarism or copyright violations. </p>
                  
                <p>  Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce 
                  content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, 
                  relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility—not 
                  the tool's—to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. If you use 
                  generative AI tools to complete assignments in this course, in ways that I have not explicitly authorized, I reserve
                  the right to apply the Honor Code to your specific case. In addition, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or 
                  fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.
                 </p>
                
                <p>In this course, the following policy dictates the acceptable use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT
                    and other similar technologies. This is a programming course and while I recognize that generative AI can
                    be a tremendous learning tool, it is my expectation that these technologies do not impede you learning 
                    the programming concepts taught in class.  However, these technologies can be used to enhance your
                    learning experience much like one would use Stack Overflow on assignments with the exception of on exams 
                    and lab quizzes which must be utilized without generative AI.

            <strong><b>Community and Identity: </b></strong>
                <p>The Center for Diversity in Engineering (CDE) is a student space dedicated to advocating for underrepresented groups in STEM. It exists to 
                connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world. The CDE includes
                an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural
                fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.</p>

          <strong><b>Harrassment, Discrimination and Interpersonal Violence:</b></strong>
        </p><p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
          If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website 
          that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
          <p>The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  
            UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, 
            marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, 
            religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. </p>
        <p>If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It 
          (<a href="justreportit.virginia.edu">justreportit.virginia.edu</a>) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p>
          <p>If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to 
            Counseling &amp; Psychological Services ("CAPS") and Women's Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).</p>
        <p>As your professors, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As faculty members, we are
          responsible employees, which means that we are required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report 
          to us to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and 
          support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. </p>
