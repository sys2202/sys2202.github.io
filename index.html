                </p><p>After each lecture, you will complete a reflection quiz. 
                  The quiz will contain questions that require you to reflect upon what you learned during the lecture, what topics you still have questions about, anything that helped or hindered your learning, and 3-5 short-answer questions about the lecture topic. 
                  Please keep in mind that the closed questions for the midterm and final exams will have the same format as the RQ questions. 
                  RQs are intended to be completed by the end of class. 
                  If you miss the lecture, you can complete the RQ by reviewing the lecture slides, recordings (if available), and resources. To receive RQ completion credit, you must submit it by <strong>Wednesday at 23:59</strong>.

                  These labs will be roughly divided into two parts. 
                  In the first part, cases and examples related to the current week’s topic and/or previous assignments are provided, and you follow along on your laptop. 
                  Lab exercises will often span multiple weeks, and we will work on a new chunk each week as we learn more concepts and techniques. 
                  In the second part of the lab, you will work on a new assignment independently or with your classmates while receiving assistance from the instructors and TAs. 
                  Labs are intended to be completed by the end of class. 
                  If you miss attending the lab for any reason, including illness, you must complete it on your own. 
                  To receive lab completion credit, this lab assignment must be completed and submitted on Canvas by <strong>Friday at 23:59</strong>.

                </p><p>SYS2202 is a hands-on course, making practice essential beyond class time. 
                  We will use DataCamp, an interactive platform, to allow you to practice and review some of the topics covered in the course. 
                  You will receive an invitation to join DataCamp, which you must accept immediately. 
                  Please ensure you can access and navigate the platform, and if you face any issues, please inform us immediately. 
                  Your grade will be based on the number of points earned and the completion of the assignments. 
                  To receive full credit, you must earn a minimum of 20,000 XP. 
                  There are 5 optional assignments for extra credit, due on the last day of class. 
                  You can earn an extra credit for an additional 6,000 XP beyond the requirement.

                  your dorm room if you are ill with or are symptomatic for any communicable disease. I would rather you stay home and work something out with 
                  me for making up work or taking an exam than for an illness to spread through the class. If you believe you are sick, please contact Student 
                  Health for appropriate treatment or testing. </p>
                  <p>Note: Please do not email me asking for special accommodations for sickness. Instead, please make every effort to catch up with your classwork as soon as possible. You can complete RQs and labs on your own by reviewing slides and recordings before the due dates of Wednesday midnight (for RQs) and Friday midnight (for labs). You must complete 8 out of 12 for each category for full credit. For further details, please read the sections about RQs and labs. If you are unable to meet those due dates due to a severe illness, please ensure that you complete them as soon as possible for potential partial credit. However, please note that partial credit is not guaranteed and will be granted depending on the severity of the situation.

              My goal is to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options for removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. Fortunately, We have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at <a href="mailto:sdac.studenthealth@virginia.edu"></a>sdac.studenthealth@virginia.edu. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me to develop an implementation plan together.

                <br>In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any overlap in source code of 
                sufficient similarity will be potentially flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk
                about the assignment but not share code as this would potentially incur on an honor code violation.
                Regardless of circumstances we will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship
                of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded potentially
                as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating
          what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.</p>

                <strong><b>The Use of Generative AI: </b></strong> 
        
                 </p><p>
                  Generative artificial intelligence tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, 
                  video, and other content—have become widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT for text and 
                  DALL•E for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our semester 
                  together. You may use generative AI tools on assignments in this course when I explicitly permit you to 
                  do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools. </p>
                  
                  <p>If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Cite the tool you used, following 
                  the pattern for computer software given in the specified style guide. Additionally, please include a brief 
                  description of how you used the tool. If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are 
                  typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained 
                  on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result 
                  in plagiarism or copyright violations. </p>
                  
                <p>  Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce 
                  content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, 
                  relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility—not 
                  the tool's—to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. If you use 
                  generative AI tools to complete assignments in this course, in ways that I have not explicitly authorized, I reserve
                  the right to apply the Honor Code to your specific case. In addition, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or 
                  fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.
                 </p>
                
                <p>In this course, the following policy dictates the acceptable use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT
                    and other similar technologies. This is a programming course and while I recognize that generative AI can
                    be a tremendous learning tool, it is my expectation that these technologies do not impede you learning 
                    the programming concepts taught in class.  However, these technologies can be used to enhance your
                    learning experience much like one would use Stack Overflow on assignments with the exception of on exams 
                    and lab quizzes which must be utilized without generative AI.

          <strong><b>Harrassment, Discrimination and Interpersonal Violence:</b></strong>
        </p><p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
          If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website 
          that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
          <p>The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  
            UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, 
            marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, 
            religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. </p>
        <p>If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It 
          (<a href="justreportit.virginia.edu">justreportit.virginia.edu</a>) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p>
          <p>If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to 
            Counseling &amp; Psychological Services ("CAPS") and Women's Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).</p>
        <p>As your professors, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As faculty members, we are
          responsible employees, which means that we are required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report 
          to us to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and 
          support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. </p>
